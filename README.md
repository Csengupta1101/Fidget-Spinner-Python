# Fidget-Spinner-Python

The games are cool and everyone loves them. Making games can be very different from other types of programming. In here we will be creating a
fidget spinner game with python programming language.

## How To Create a Game?

As a programmer, when creating games you have to think more about the logic of the game. The logic of the game is the heart and soul of your game. It defines the game world, what things are in the universe and how they interact. It also defines how the state of the game can be altered by external stimuli, such as a human player pressing a button on the gamepad or an AI process taking action to kill you.
There are now so many programming languages that you can use to build a game. But the best choice is to use the C++ programming language. But since Python is in high demand and Python newbies don’t know much about the tasks that can be done with Python, so in the section below I will take you through how to make a game with Python.

## Create a Game with Python

Now let’s see how to create a game with Python. I am going to create a very simple game based on a fidget spinner. The logic of the game is that the turns will keep increasing as you press the space bar, and it will reduce its speed and stop at a point where you stop pressing the space bar. To create a game with Python based on the above logic of a fidget spinner I will use the Turtle module in Python. Once we execute the file , a different cmd window will prompt up. In there keep pressing the space bar to increase the speed and release the bar to slow down the speed.

## exe Operations

* Go to the dist folder in the repository.
* Download Fspinner folder along with the folder.
* Open up the powershell in the folder.
* type the filename and press tab then press enter.
* the game window will open up.

## Conclusion

This is a production ready python game alongside with the exe file in the repository. Hope you'll like it. Let me know in case any questions.
